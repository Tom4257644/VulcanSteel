<h1>Stock Pitch of Vulcan Steel</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This was for a competition run by Craigs Investment Partners and the University of Auckland Investment Club and judged by Craigs Investment Bankers. We pitched Vulcan Steel, entering the first-timers division. We made it through the first two rounds and into the finals, at which point a copy of our deck was sent to the judges. We received an email a day before the finals explaining that the bankers at Craigs believed we had a strong enough pitch to have a chance to win the open division final so we moved from the first-timers final into the open final, competing against the top students in their final years of university as first years.

Attached is our deck.
